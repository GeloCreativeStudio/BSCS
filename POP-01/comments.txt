Function to print the contents
Call the function

The code defines lists and tuples representing various programming concepts. It includes stages of the software development life-cycle, application development methodologies, Python keywords, operators like '==', '=', and '/', control structures, arithmetic operators, and three comparison operators with the last name "Manalo" at index [0]. There's a function, print_contents(), that prints these concepts. The function is then called to display the information.
